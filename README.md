# Operating System Chooser
Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume projects! I'm still a bit new to GitHub and Git, so pardon the formatting :) .

## Overview
This is the first project on my resume, an operating system chooser created using Java in NetBeans. There are three main parts to this project: 
- Operating System Classes
- A Decision Tree
- A User Client Class

This project is currently the most advanced project on my resume, with it using advanced data structures, inheritance, and searching and sorting.

### Operating System Classes
The first class used in this project is the `OperatingSystem.java` class. This class is used as a base class so the more advanced operating system classes (Windows, MacOS, and Linux) can inherit from it. The class `OperatingSystem.java` contains public get and set methods of different variables, including: `name`, `releaseData`, `cost`, and `use`. A `toString()` method is also found in `OperatingSystem.java`.

The `Windows.java`, `MacOS.java`, and `Linux.java` classes are all similar in nature; they are all derived classes from the `OperatingSystem.java` class. Each class continues the use of the previous variables from `OperatingSystem.java`, however, each class also adds another unique variable (with its own get, set, and updated `toString()` method) to differentiate from each other. `Windows.java` adds the `assistant` variable, `MacOS.java` adds the `updatedDesign` variable, and `Linux.java` adds the `preinstalledApps` variable.

### Decision Tree
The decision tree used in this project is an advanced data structure that uses a nested binary tree along with yes and no branches.

### User Client/Interface
